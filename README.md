# SparkJava Framework - REST- APIs with SBT
[SparkJava](http://sparkjava.com) is a great framework for creating quick web services.
I used fork from:
- [Baeldung](http://www.baeldung.com/spark-framework-rest-api)
- [Seun Matthew](http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/cloud-contact-app)

These were great guides. Hopefully this helps the java enthusiasta as well.
